## Overview

This repo includes the research artifact for our paper [**"An FPGA Accelerator for Genome Variant Calling"**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9786183) published at FCCM 2022.

The paper presents an FPGA based accelerator enabling [LoFreq](https://github.com/CSB5/lofreq) to perform variant calling on genome data 20X faster. The HLS implementation of the accelerator is shared and described in this repo.
